h1. Find those localization keys!

This is a small SBT plugin that lets you find localization keys in your Lift web application. The finder code was originally posted by Derek, so props to him for that, I have just made it available to the world ;-)

h2. Usage

First, add it to your SBT project plugins:

<pre><code>
  import sbt._
  class Plugins(info: ProjectInfo) extends PluginDefinition(info) {
    val locfinder = "eu.getintheloop" % "sbt-locfinder-plugin" % "0.1.0"
  }
</code></pre>

Then, from your SBT prompt just hit:

<code>
  > find-locs
</code>

The result should be something like:

<pre><code>
  [info] == find-locs ==
  [info] Here's a list of all the localization keys in your webapp: 

  anotherthing=
  mystring=

  [info] == find-locs ==
</code></pre>
